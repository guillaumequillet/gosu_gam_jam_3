Construction Tasks ! is a simple Game done during the Gosu Game Jam 3 by Guillaume Quillet aka "Bestguigui".

It mimiks the game series Cook Serve Delicious : 
- a series a tasks is poping on the left part of the screen*
- to handle one, you have to select if using the appropriate key number (numpad is also compatible)
- then, you have to enter a series of inputs to provide the appropriate action
- when the sequence is correct, the task is completed, gives some points and is removed from the list
- tasks are available only a little time and then start to scroll to the left. If it goes all the way left, you'll have some malus
- reach a certain score to get to next phase
- finish all phases to beat the game.

Game was developped using the Ruby programming language and the gem Gosu only. You can run the script from the ./init.rb file or using the provided .exe file on Windows.
